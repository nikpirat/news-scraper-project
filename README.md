# üì∞ News Article Web Scraper & Analyzer

**News Article Web Scraper & Analyzer** is a Python-based project designed to extract news articles from the web, preprocess their text content, and generate insightful visualizations. It helps users explore language patterns and analyze article content by cleaning the text, computing word frequencies, and visualizing trends. This tool is great for learning web scraping, text preprocessing, and data visualization using Python.

## üöÄ Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically fetch headlines, article text, and publication dates from online news sources.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text by removing punctuation, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and tokenizing.
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Extract and display the most common words across scraped articles.
- **Visualization**: Create bar plots and charts to explore trends like word usage and article lengths.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries Used

The project uses the following technologies:

- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations (e.g., analyzing article lengths).
  - **Pandas**: For data handling, cleaning, and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib**: To visualize word frequency, trends, and statistics.
  - **NLTK**: For natural language processing (stopword removal, tokenization).
  - **Newspaper3k**: Simplifies web scraping of news articles.
